This package provides a system of modules to manage and configure network
interfaces via individual per-interface scripts in /etc/init.d.  Provided
is the parent script "/etc/init.d/net.lo", which should be symlinked to
create additional scripts for each interface to be configured:

	ln -s /etc/init.d/net.{lo,eth0}

Configuration is handled in "/etc/conf.d/net".  A default (empty or missing)
/etc/conf.d/net automatically uses DHCP to configure any network interfaces 
started by these scripts.  To create a more complete configuration, please 
review net.example* in this directory and save your configuration 
in /etc/conf.d/net.
