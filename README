netifrc README

You should probably go and read the OpenRC README.

netifrc is what was previously called 'oldnet' in OpenRC, and was the only
networking system in Baselayout 1.x. This system has been around a very long
time, at least as far back as September 2001 (that was the rc-scripts-1.1.5
release).

If you're interested in who contributed to this, please see the extensive
CREDITS file.

Reporting Bugs
--------------
Since Gentoo Linux is hosting OpenRC development, Bugs should go to
the Gentoo Bugzilla:
	http://bugs.gentoo.org/
They should be filed under the "Gentoo Hosted Projects" product and
the "netifrc" component.
